//! Offline block-building benchmark (`ethlambda benchmark`).
//!
//! Drives the exact production proposer path — `produce_block_with_signatures`,
//! the same entry `BlockChainServer::propose_block` uses — against a synthetic
//! in-memory chain, and reports per-phase timing distributions. Gossip publish
//! and the slot-alignment sleep are outside the measured span, matching the
//! node's own `lean_block_building_time_seconds` boundary.
//!
//! See docs/plans/block-building-benchmark.md for the design and roadmap
//! (real-crypto pools and replay-from-datadir land in later milestones).
